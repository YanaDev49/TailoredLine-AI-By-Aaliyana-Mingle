## Feature Inspiration 💡

Welcome to Tailored-line AI🚆✨- a feature designed to create personalised travel itineraries for Trainline customers. It’s a wonderfully inclusive, data-driven solution that enhances our customers’ travel experiences while using our service!

Tailored-line is a feature I developed, inspired by Trainline's Inspiration travel blog 🌍 and Europe travel itinerary 🗺️.

![alt text](image-1.png)

The idea came to me as I was reading Trainlines website: What if we could take this part of our service to the next level? By adding a personalised touch with new generational, cutting-edge technology, we could create something truly special. I wanted to design this feature in a way that would align with Trainline's core values - delivering data-driven solutions 📊, fostering inclusivity 🌈, and, most importantly, ensuring every customer enjoys their travel experience with simplicity and positivity 😊.

At Trainline, we're dedicated to solving Problems to deliver pragmatical and simple solutions 📈

### So imagine this...  🤔

#### Meet our Trainliner, Ruby 👋

![alt text](image-3.png)

Ruby is travelling to Milan using Trainline’s services, but she hasn’t planned out her journey or itinerary. She decides to explore Trainline’s Inspiration travel blog 🌍 and Europe travel itinerary 🗺️ for some ideas. While these resources provide some great inspiration, Ruby feels she still needs a more structured and tailored plan to guide her trip.

That’s when she discovers Trainline’s newly launched Tailored-line feature 👀✨ a tool designed to create personalised travel itineraries with just one click. Instead of piecing together a plan herself and risking potential mistakes 🚧; especially in an unfamiliar city 🏙️, Ruby now has a seamless, all-in-one itinerary created just for her. In moments, her travel worries are replaced with excitement 🎉, and she’s ready to enjoy her trip with clarity and confidence 😊.

Let’s take a closer look at Ruby’s experience with Tailored-line AI and how this personalised approach transforms travel planning into a stress-free and enjoyable process 🚆💼.

##

## Ruby's Tailored Experience 🧭

![alt text](image-4.png)

All Ruby needs to do is enter her Trainline user ID so that Tailored-line can sync her account and previous travel history to understand logical travel preferences like student discount , cheapest fare , first class , and refundable tickets.

Then she can select the "Get Travel Recommendations" button to move on to the next stage. 👉📲

![alt text](image-5.png)

 Ruby is the  greeted by our Tailored-line bot and is encouraged to take a quick travel questionnaire that will take some details about her trip 📝. These details will be used as data to generate her personalised itinerary based on factual information about her travel.🌍

![alt text](image-6.png)

This questionnaire is designed specifically to collect data about Ruby's travel destination (Milan)📍...

![alt text](image-7.png)

Ruby's Dietary Requirements (in this instance, Ruby is vegan) 🥗

![alt text](image-8.png)

The area of Ruby's stay location (hotel) 🏨

![alt text](image-9.png)

And Ruby's activity preferences 🎨🏞️...

Now, this is where the magic ✨ actually begins as Ruby is redirected to a Trainline webpage with her personalised itinerary displayed in sequenced and organised sections! 📄🗺️🚆

![alt text](image-10.png)

The first section will display places that Ruby can visit on her trip to Milan 🏛️🖼️ based on the preferences selected in the questionnaire! 

![alt text](image-11.png)

The second section will display vegan dining options for Ruby 🥗🌱, taking away the hassle of having to search for all of these restaurants beforehand. 🍴✅

![alt text](image-12.png)

The third section will display train stations 🚉 in or near the area of Ruby's hotel 🏨. This is to ensure that Ruby can get around the city with the knowledge of transport facilities, making travelling around Milan much easier. 🚆🗺️

![alt text](image-13.png)

The fourth and last section will display some travel tips 💡 that Ruby may benefit from on her trip. This will include the best ways to save money 💷 and the recommended methods of transport. 🚖💼

![alt text](image-14.png)

This is a concise and clear representation of how Tailored-line AI will be experienced by our users and how implementing a real-life example (Ruby) can really make this feature come to life. ✨

Tailored-line isn’t just an additional feature for trainline services. It’s a system that allows our customers to have a fulfilling, personalised, and safe travel experience, making every trip enjoyable and seamless. 🚆

Ultimately, people may not remember what a service did for them, but how the service made them feel and the lengths gone to create that impact (like it did for Ruby 😊).

# How Hypothesis-Driven Development became the backbone of Tailored-line 🔍🧩

![alt text](image-16.png)

Software development often involves a degree of **uncertainty**. Developers strive to solve problems and build features that meet user needs, but it’s all too easy to fall into the trap of building for **assumptions** rather than facts. 🔍

I first encountered the concept of **Hypothesis-Driven Development (HDD)** while reading a blog post on Trainline’s Medium channel titled *"Lessons from Hypothesis-Driven Development."* The post discussed how **HDD** had become a core practice within Trainline's **Conversion Rate Optimisation (CRO)** team, which I found very interesting. 📚

After reading this, I began to reflect on my own development process and asked myself, *'How can I implement this solution within Tailored-line?'* It struck me that using **HDD** could provide a more **systematic** and **pragmatic** way to ensure that my feature was truly aligned with **user needs** at Trainline and delivered **meaningful value**. 💡

Following this, I started researching the impact of **tailored** and **personalised** features on **user engagement**. A study titled *"Validation of User Preferences and Effects of Personalized Gamification"* found that **software features reflecting user preferences significantly improve engagement and task performance**. Participants using **personalised settings** reported a more enjoyable experience and showed higher interaction rates. 📊

For Tailored-line, having a **questionnaire** to gather data about users' **travel preferences** and syncing itineraries with their **past travel history** can improve **engagement**. This approach enhances the **relevance** of travel recommendations and creates a more **seamless**, **personalised travel experience**. ✈️

**[Link to study](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/computer-science/articles/10.3389/fcomp.2020.00029/full)** 📎

This research helped me foresee how **Tailored-line** could **positively impact Trainline’s customers**. By going the extra mile to ensure that each **itinerary recommendation** was **thoughtfully tailored** to individual preferences, the app wouldn’t just meet **user needs** but would create **moments of delight**. It became clear to me that **HDD** wasn’t just a method to improve **accuracy**—it was a way to embed **empathy** into development. ✨

The process of applying **HDD** to **Tailored-line** has been a **transformative experience**. It taught me to think more **critically** about the **purpose** behind every feature I develop. It also showed me that by taking a **hypothesis-driven approach**, we can build more **meaningful products** that **resonate with users on a deeper level**. 💻


### Now, Lets dive into the technical Components of Tailored-line and how the technologies I used assemble together to create this solution!
#

# 📝 Technologies I used for Tailored-line 📋

### These are the core technologies used to build and run the application itself:

| **Technologies**            | **Description**                          |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 🐍 **Python Flask**          | I used Flask to build the backend of my app, handling the user questionnaire and generating personalised itineraries based on the data collected. |
| 📦 **Redis**                 | Redis is used to store the answers from my questionnaire and manage session data, ensuring quick access to user responses and improving the app’s performance. |
| 📜 **JavaScript**            | I used JavaScript to make the frontend interactive and responsive, allowing users to smoothly complete the questionnaire and view their personalised itineraries. |
| 🧠 **Model**                 | I developed a model that processes user responses from the questionnaire to generate personalised itineraries tailored to Trainline user preferences. |
| 🌐 **HTML**                  | HTML structures the content of my app’s user interface, making it straightforward for users to navigate through the questionnaire and results. |
| 🎨 **CSS**                   | CSS styles the user interface, ensuring the app looks clean, modern, and visually appealing. |
| 🐳 **Docker Compose**        | I used Docker Compose to manage both the app and its dependencies, such as Redis, making it simple to deploy my application consistently across different environments. |
| 🛠️ **Docker**                | Docker allowed me to containerise my app, ensuring it runs smoothly and reliably on any system without compatibility issues. |

# Key parts of my code and explanation 📡💻

![alt text](image-18.png)

In essence, Tailored-line is a flask web application that uses a python module model to simulate the behaviour of a recomendation system/machine learning AI model. It uses data from the user questionnaire and stores this in the redis database so that it can be retrieved to generate the personalised itinerary for the user. 

The python module uses pre-loaded CSV data files of user travel preferences and train schedules to apply logic, creating the perfect recommended travel options for their journey. The model joins the data from the CSV files with the data stored in redis from the questionnaire and generates a personalised itinerary for the user based on all this data. 

### Lets take a look at the main code functions of Tailored-line
#
#### app.py code

![alt text](image-19.png)

This is the /recommend route of my application that handles the part of the application that takes in the user inputs as data in redis and uses a function to generate the users itinerary and load the data to do this.

The /recommend route handles both GET and POST requests. The GET request is specifically for saving user questionnaire data in redis and the POST request is for displaying the itinerary within the function generate_itineray (). 

# 

#### model.py code

![alt text](image-20.png)

This is apart of my model.py code that shows the process of joining the travel preferences and train schedule CSV file data and applying logic to match key value pairs like is_student = student discount in a get_recommendations function. This matches travel preferences with correct values to create perfect tailored options. 

#

#### Javascript code 

![alt text](image-21.png)

The function LoadQuestions() displays each question dynamically on the user page and checks for the right input data which is the expected response. 

![alt text](image-22.png)

The updateJsonString() funtion stores the user data inputs from the questionnaire as a JSON string.

![alt text](image-23.png)

The submitToQuestionnaire() function communicates with the python backend and sends the user inputs in the form of json data as a post request to the /recommend route.
#
# Local App Set up 🖥️

### Build and run our containers 🐳
```
 docker-compose --build
```
This command builds the images for my multi-container Trainline app as defined in the docker-compose.yml file. It reads the Dockerfile for each service, such as my Flask app and Redis, and creates the necessary images to run the application.
```                        
docker-compose up
```
This command builds the images and starts the containers in one step. In this app, if I’ve made changes to the Dockerfile or any dependencies, this command ensures the images are rebuilt before the app starts running.
